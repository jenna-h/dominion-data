# dominion-data
Canonicalized digital card images and some Python scripts to play with them.

The digital card images were taken off of the Dominion Strategy wiki on March 3, 2022 (specifically http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/images/).

The following Google sheet was used to determine which cards exist in the game and how many there are of each (as of March 3, 2022).
